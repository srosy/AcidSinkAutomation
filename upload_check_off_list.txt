This document is the normal upload procedure followed to successfully run the Acid Hood software.


1. In the Main_gui.py code, at the top of the code where Global variables are declared and set, change variables:

drainTime -- Long Sink: 210, Double Sink: 450.
rinseTime -- Long Sink: 105, Double Sink: 105.

2. Ensure image path is correct in code. Press CTRL+F and type image into the search box and find the only place
and image is used in the code. Each raspberry pi uses a different foldername, so the master copy of the code will
differ in file image path. Change the portion of the file image path to the correct folder name, otherwise program
WILL NOT boot.

3. To set program to fullscreen, press CTRL+F and type in the word zoom into the search box in the main_gui.py code.
You will be brought to the end of the the code with a comment explaining that you can enable/disable the GUI from fullscreen
to a traditional window by interchanging the words "zoom" and "fullscreen" in the line of code.
