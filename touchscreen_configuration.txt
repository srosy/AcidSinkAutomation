This document is to help configure the official Raspberry pi 7" Capactivive Touchscreen. Ensure that touchscreen
hardware is connected correctly and that touchscreen displays at the least.

	Display Rotation.

		1. In the terminal, navigate to "/boot/config.txt".
		
		2. at the bottom of the text if line doesn't already exist, add: "display_rotate=2" or "display_rotate=3"
		
	Touchscreen Axis Inversion.
		
		1. In the terminal execute "sudo apt-get install xinput" Ensure there is proper internet connection.
		
		2. "xinput --set-prop 'FT5406 memory based driver' 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix. 0 -1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1"

		This will change the axis of the touchscreen to fit the portrait layout display.
		NOTE: Unless a script is written with this axis inversion and set to run at boot, everytime system is
		      restarted, the touchscreen axis will be reset to default and will not save.
