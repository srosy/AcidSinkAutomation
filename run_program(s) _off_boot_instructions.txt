This document is provided to help successfully run scripts after the desktop has been initialized
in the Linux kernel sequence.

1. Create the .sh file.

	Write the script you want to run and at the top of the file for the first line of code add "#!/bin/sh -e".
	Doing so informs Linux that this is an executable file.

2. Give Permission to execute file on boot.

	In the terminal type the command: "chmod +x /path/to/yourScript.sh".
		

3. Create and point to a desktop entry application.
	
	In the terminal navigate to the directory "/home/pi/.config/autostart".

	In the terminal type the command: "-create appName.desktop".

	Open and edit the file you just created and type:
		
		"[Desktop Entry]
		 Type=Application
		 Exec=/home/pi/Desktop/yourScript.sh"

	Save and Exit.
